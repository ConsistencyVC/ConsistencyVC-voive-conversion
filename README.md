The whisper medium model can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZsfQg3PUZuu1k6nHvavd6OcOB_8m1Aa/view?usp=drive_link

The pre-trained models are available here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KvMN1V8BWCzJd-N8hfyP283rLQBKIbig?usp=sharing

Use ppg.py to generate the PPG.

Use preprocess_ppg.py to generate the WEO.
